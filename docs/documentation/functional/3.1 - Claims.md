# Claims

SympAuthy can be used to centralize information collected about the end-user.

Out of the box, SympAuthy supports all claims standardized in the [OpenID specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). They are refered as [standard claims](#standard-claims) through this documentation.

In addition to [standard claims](#standard-claims), you can define your own claim about the end-user. It allows you to centralize additional info about the end-user that you want to share between the clients of this authorization server. Those claims are refered as [custom claims](#custom-claims) through this documentation.
